# Vedant Paranjape
I am Vedant, a second year student at VJTI, Mumbai. I am currently doing B.Tech in Electronics Engineering. I love coding since i was in 10th, I got selected for Google Summer of Code, under BeagleBoard.org. My project is implementing REPL for PRU. I have a keen interest in C++ and C, and as a result in embedded, I have decent experience with C++, C, python, esp32, boost C++ libraries.
