# Coding Period (7th June - 16th August)

## 28th June 2021
* Stuck on a issue, it was about execution order of request pad function, and the detection of reconfig flag in `_task_run` function.

## 29th June 2021
* Worked on the earlier issues, asked around about it to mentors.

## 30th June 2021

## 3rd July 2021
