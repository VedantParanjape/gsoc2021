# Coding Period (7th June - 16th August)

## 7th June 2021
* Implemented the required functions to use request pads, submitted a patch, check here
[https://lists.libcamera.org/pipermail/libcamera-devel/2021-June/021133.html](https://lists.libcamera.org/pipermail/libcamera-devel/2021-June/021133.html)

## 8th June 2021
* Earlier patch had issues with locking, I was trying to lock a C++ class rather than a GstObject. Worked on this.

## 9th June 2021
* Locking `src->state_` was not working, and locking `src` caused a deadlock. Worked on fixing this issue.

## 10th June 2021
* Identified the issue due to which locking `src` caused a deadlock, I was calling GstElement API after locking the element, which was not clearly allowed.

## 11th June 2021
* Due to the way code was written, it was not possible to call GstElement API function outside the lock's scope. 
* Refactored the code, to solve the issue. Such that GstElement API was called before and on the basis of it's result, the pad was added to `srcpad_` vector which was a operation that needed to be protected by a mutex.
* Sent a RFC patch with the fix, check here [https://lists.libcamera.org/pipermail/libcamera-devel/2021-June/021286.html](https://lists.libcamera.org/pipermail/libcamera-devel/2021-June/021286.html)

## 12th June 2021
* Couldn't work due to some urgent work.

## 13th June 2021
* Couldn't work due to Research Internship work.
