# Coding Period (1st June - 31st August)

## 13 July 2020

* Read about RPMSG, tried to resolve blockers

## 14th July 2020
 
* Went through am335x TRM, and looked up ways to use ecap module as PWM as suggested by mentors

## 15th July 2020

* Wrote rpmsg wrapper functions and tested the same on PRU

## 16th July 2020

* Added headers necessary to use rpmsg and ecap pwm
* Added rpmsg support to language, completed code printer for the same.
* Used macro to find which pru is the code being compiled, `-mmcu` defines macros `_AM335X_PRU0__`, used this in code to make RPMSG change configuration to according to PRU used. Got help from dinuxbg: [https://github.com/dinuxbg/gnupru/issues/36](https://github.com/dinuxbg/gnupru/issues/36)

## 17th July 2020

* Went through am335x TRM to understand how to use eCap module to generate PWM

## 18th July 2020

* Wrote pru_ecap.h with complete bit fields referring to the TRM, wrote code for running PWM using eCap, it worked.

## 19th July 2020

* Due to some unknown reason, eCap PWM stopped working, trying it to make it work.
* Wrote docs for rpmsg, and implemented examples for the same.
